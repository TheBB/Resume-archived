I am a 29 year old Norwegian, born, grown up and with undergraduate studies in Trondheim,
Norway. Moved to Zürich, Switzerland for graduate studies. Interested in mathematics, computing,
programming, photography, chess and books.


\section{EDUCATION} 

{\em Ph.D.}, applied mathematics \hfill 2009-09 $\to$ 2013-11 \\
ETH \zh, \zh, Switzerland \\
Solving high-dimensional kinetic transport equations, bridging the ``curse of
dimensionality''. Particular focus on Shearlet frames and the Boltzmann equation.

{\em Master of Technology}, industrial mathematics \hfill 2004-08 $\to$ 2009-06 \\
NTNU, Trondheim, Norway \\
Specialisation in numerical analysis and differential geometry.


\section{SKILLS}

{\em Programming:} Python, Matlab, Haskell, C, C++, C$\sharp$, Java, PHP, JS \\
{\em Databases:} PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL \\
{\em Assorted computer:} \LaTeX, (X)HTML, CSS, XML \\
{\em Operating Systems:} Assorted Linux distributions, Windows \\
{\em Languages:} Fluent Norwegian and English, decent German


\section{EXPERIENCE}

{\em Research Scientist} \hfill 2014-05 $\to$ present \\
SINTEF Applied Mathematics, Trondheim, Norway
Large-scale parallel simulations using isogeometric analysis finite element methods.

{\em Ph.D. student} \hfill 2009-09 $\to$ 2013-11 \\
ETH \zh, \zh, Switzerland \\
Solving high-dimensional kinetic transport equations, bridging the ``curse of dimensionality''.
Implementation in Matlab and Python. Includes a 40\% teaching load.

{\em Software engineer} \hfill Summer 2009 \\
Jeeves, Trondheim, Norway \\
Implemented a translation tool built on Google Translate, which can read and write a number of
different formats (such as Microsoft Word and database tables), with some facilities for correcting
erroneous translations and learning.

{\em Software engineer} \hfill Summer 2008 \\
Yahoo! Technologies, Trondheim, Norway \\
Implemented an adapter between MySQL and Yahoo's internal vertical search platform Vespa, together
with several demo cases. Responsibilities included the entire process, from design to completion.

{\em Scientific assistant} \hfill Summer 2007 \\
ETH \zh, \zh, Switzerland \\
Implemented a finite volume method for solving the convection/diffusion/reaction equation in
Matlab. Also did some post-processing of photonic crystal simulations. This was an IAESTE
internship.
