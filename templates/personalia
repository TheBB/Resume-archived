I am a \VAR{age} year old Norwegian, born, grown up and with
undergraduate studies in Trondheim, Norway. Moved to ZÃ¼rich,
Switzerland for graduate studies, then back to Trondheim and later
Wageningen, Netherlands for work in applied mathematics research.  I
never stop learning new things. Interested in mathematics, computing,
open source software, photography, chess, history and reading.
